Earth-Abundant Catalysts for Hydrogen Production
PhD Project Interest
Status: Active
This is my primary research focus during my PhD studies. Hydrogen production, primarily for the steel industry and ammonia synthesis, contributes to approximately 10% of global CO2 emissions. This is because 95% of industrial hydrogen production occurs via steam reforming of methane, a process that emits carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide along with hydrogen gas."><meta name=author content="Me"><link rel=canonical href=http://localhost:55252/research/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.04469d6bc57599b52cdfbe43068f1aaa67e778bb989af7cc76eb1cc5b07084c7.css integrity="sha256-BEada8V1mbUs375DBo8aqmfneLuYmvfMduscxbBwhMc=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=http://localhost:55252/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=http://localhost:55252/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=http://localhost:55252/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=http://localhost:55252/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=mask-icon href=http://localhost:55252/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=http://localhost:55252/research/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="http://localhost:55252/research/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Helen Engelhardt"><meta property="og:title" content="Research"><meta property="og:description" content="Welcome to my research page!

Current methods fail to effectively remove microplastics smaller than 20 micrometers, generate waste, and are not scalable for industrial aplications. This project aimed to answer the question, how can we remove microplastics from drinking water in a healthy, environmentally conscious, and scalable way?\nMicroSeize consists of two main components:\nChemical design: Magnetize microplastics using iron oxide nanoparticles designed for high adsorption efficiency, recyclability, and selectivity. Mechanical design: Develop a scalable system based on existing industrial batch reactors to capture magnetized microplastics effectively. My specific contribution was to synthesize iron oxide nanoparticles and assess their performance at removing different types of plastic from water. Our team successfully produced a bench scale prototype that was able to remove 98% of microplastics from a sample of drinking water, including plastics smaller than 20 microns.\nThere is a patent pending for this design.\nFor more information, you can view our poster or read about the project in Waterloo News\n","wordCount":"421","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:55252/research/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Helen Engelhardt","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:55252/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:55252/ accesskey=h title="Helen Engelhardt (Alt + H)">Helen Engelhardt</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://localhost:55252/cv/ title=CV><span>CV</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:55252/research/ title=Research><span class=active>Research</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=http://localhost:55252/>Home</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Research</h1></header><div class=post-content><p>Welcome to my research page!</p><p>This page is an introduction for non-specialists to some of the areas and projects I have worked on or am currently exploring in an academic context.
